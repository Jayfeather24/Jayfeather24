Recently, a new AI service called ChatGPT gained worldwide popularity. So, what is this AI and what does it do? ChatGPT is a trained language model that can answer questions, chat with you, and so on. As a student, I have found ChatGPT to be very helpful in assisting with studying. There are three aspects of ChatGPT that make it excellent for studying, its convenience, quality, and customization.

ChatGPT is very convenient to use, as it is in website form, which means you don’t have to download any software, and you can use it on any device. It’s proficient in several dozen languages, so if your English is shoddy, it can understand and generate answers in Chinese. However, you may need a VPN to use ChatGPT in China(btw you also need to pay 1 dollar for SMS verification), which is inconvenient, to say the least. 

ChatGPT’s answers are very high-quality when answering language-related questions, it’s very creative and knowledgeable. But ChatGPT may occasionally make up things or give false information answering fact-related questions. When using facts or information that ChatGPT gives it’s important to be careful.

ChatGPT is highly customizable, as you can make rules for it guiding how it answers. No code is needed, just plain English will do. It also remembers what is said earlier in the conversation, modifying the answer based on it. You can change ChatGPT into a personalized tutor, search engine, or other things.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is best used for writing and asking quick questions, making studying and working more efficient. It also has its drawbacks, it can be inaccurate and it’s highly dependent on technology to use. For me though, ChatGPT has assisted studying greatly, but, of course, it can’t actually compare to a real teacher.
