Recently, a new AI service called ChatGPT has gained worldwide popularity. So, what is this AI, and what does it do? ChatGPT is a trained language model that can answer questions and chat with you, among other things. As a student, I have found ChatGPT to be very helpful in assisting with studying. There are three aspects of ChatGPT that make it excellent for studying: its convenience, quality, and customization.

ChatGPT is very convenient to use since it is in website form, which means you don't have to download any software, and you can use it on any device. It is proficient in several dozen languages, so if your English is not great, it can understand and generate answers in Chinese. However, you may need a VPN to use ChatGPT in China (also, you need to pay $1 for SMS verification), which is inconvenient, to say the least.

When answering language-related questions, ChatGPT's answers are of very high quality. It is creative and knowledgeable. However, when answering fact-related questions, ChatGPT may occasionally make up things or give false information. It is important to be careful when using facts or information that ChatGPT provides.

ChatGPT is highly customizable. You can make rules for it to guide how it answers, and no coding is needed. It also remembers what was said earlier in the conversation and modifies the answer based on that. You can change ChatGPT into a personalized tutor, search engine, or other things.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is best used for writing and asking quick questions, making studying and working more efficient. It also has its drawbacks, such as being inaccurate and highly dependent on technology to use. For me, however, ChatGPT has greatly assisted in studying. But, of course, it cannot compare to a real teacher.
